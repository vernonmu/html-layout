        <p>Players, put your pinky rings up to the moon. Girls, what are you all trying to do? 24 karat magic in the air. Head to toe, so player. Uh oh, look out! Pop pop, it's show time. Show time. Guess who's back again? Oh, they don't know? Go on tell 'em. I bet they will know as soon as we walk in. We will be wearing Cuban links, yes. And, designer minks, yes. And, even, Inglewood's finest shoes. I should warn you not to look too hard, or you might hurt yourself. </p>
